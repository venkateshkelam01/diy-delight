# WEB103 Project 4 - *Bolt Bucket ‚ö°Ô∏è*

Submitted by: **Venkatesh Kelam**

About this web app:  
**Bolt Bucket** is a full-stack car customization web application where users can design their own dream sports car.  
It allows users to configure multiple features such as **exterior colors**, **roof types**, **wheels**, and **interior themes** ‚Äî all with live previews, dynamic pricing, and database persistence.  
Each selection instantly updates the car preview and the total cost, making it a sleek, interactive configurator.  
The app uses **React (Vite)** for the frontend, **Node.js + Express** for the backend, and **PostgreSQL** (hosted on **Render**) as the database.  
It also features a visually engaging design with a race-car hero background and transparent glass-style UI.

Time spent: **22 hours**
